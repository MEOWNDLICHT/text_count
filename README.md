# Text Count Analyser
This program can be use to approximate the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in a .txt / .pdf / .docx file extension. This is especially accurate when used with .txt files as they are relatively easier to handle than .docx or .pdf files which has more complicated structures and thus requires more complex text extraction (skill issue on my part).
